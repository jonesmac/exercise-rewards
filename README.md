# Exercise Rewards

Having trouble exercising?  Would getting paid in crypto help?  We thinks so :smile This project is designed to be a simple [DApp](https://www.dapp.com) that connects to a smart contract that pays you in etherum every time you exercise.

## Personas
* Exerciser - Someone who owns an account and wants to be paid to exercise
* Approver - Someone who will be willing to trigger the payout each time the exerciser completes a workout
* Payer - The party (could be exerciser or approver or neither) that deposits the reward(s) into the contract.

## High-level todos
* Integrate smart contract with React app
* Add support to look up existing contracts and let approvers approve payouts
